### About Me
I'm super-friendly, committed to ideals and goals of professionalism thowse of which I usually highlight being: communication forfthcoming, objectivity,  , belive work should be and humans are not machines a andm machunes are not ppeopole

In 2014, I started ProtoBuilds.com a 3D printing and prototyping company after success on the early service aggregator platforms: 3Dhubs and Makexyz.

I have worked for dozens of companies providing 3D printing, CNC machining, prototyping and design services (since 2014) across a wide range of industries from: consumer products, medical devices, light industrial machine equipment, defence and for companies large and small. I have provided digital fabrication services, consulting or design work for firms like SpaceX, NXP, Ottobock just to name a few.

Over the many years, I have worked in a variety of capacities either short-term, contract by-the-hour, all-inclusive project, on-site or remote depending on needs of client/project. Services required of me have been valued anywhere from a few hundred dollars to 10's of thousands of dollars, requiring me to: propose, estimate, quote, invoice, manage and deliver a variety of complex projects, maintain my own commercial office as well as acquire, train and retain a staff ranging from 1-4 people.

ProtoBuilds started out as a quick answer to when people asked for more in depth assistance with their project and grew into a unique, small yet professional, product development and creative fabrication studio. I have 100’s of pictures from its peak years. It was a lot of fun.

Nowadays I work solo as a freelance industrial designer for select projects or companies and enjoy free time hanging out with my 1 year old Australian Kelpie and 14 year old, yet still adventurous, cat.

I have enjoyed being a business owner, exploring my passions, interests, realizing dreams of mine, and of others whose dreams I helped turn into reality. I believe my experience may be unique for its variety.


My specialties are design for rapid manufacturing (3D printing), 2.5D + 3D CNC machining, SLA, SLS, FDM and fabrication of items or assemblies for end-use function, aesthetic prototypes, or short run-manufacturing.

My design software of choice is Fusion 360. I’m proficient in many of its areas and have been using that software since its approximate year of release (2013). I am also well practiced in a variety of hand fabrication tools, power tools and the like.
